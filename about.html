      <br>
<p>
    European influence began when Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. Most of the islands in the Caribbean was claimed during four
    of his journeys. During the next few centuries while Europe, Spain, France, Holland, Portugal and Britain where fighting for these
    new found areas the indigenous people of the Caribbean disappeared and with them most Amerindian visual art also.
      <br>
    European influence is very visible in today's culture, linguistics, religions, politics, academics and sports. The most noteable
    type of Art seen today is Architecture. Some of the most well known European influenced architecture in the Caribbean are:

      </div>
<p>
   Africans where the first to populate the Caribbean Islands against free will. Our African Ancestors endured many harships
   throughtout their lives in the plantations of our islands.Today many 'Afro-centric' artist  artworks reflect their strong sense od self and their identity.
    African artist represented their Gods by carving ceremonial tools,
   furniture and utensils. Na√Øve art evolved from religions such as:
   <br>
   <ul class="list2">
     <li> Orishas </li>
     <li> Santeria</li>
     <li> Shouter Baptist</li>

   </ul>
</p>

     <div class="EastIndianinfo">
       <h1>East Indian influence</h1>
     </div>
<p>
    East Indians brought with them their religons and cultures. Their art displayed their religous images, clothing,
    jewllery, musical instruments, tools, utensils and pottery. These East Indians arrived to the Caribbean in indetureship and a system of hired labour.
